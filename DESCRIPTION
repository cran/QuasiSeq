Description: Identify differentially expressed genes in RNA-seq count data using quasi-Poisson or quasi-negative binomial models with 'QL', 'QLShrink' and 'QLSpline' methods described by Lund, Nettleton, McCarthy, and Smyth (2012) <DOI:10.1515/1544-6115.1826>. Report bias-reduced estimates of log fold changes.
